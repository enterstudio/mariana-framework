# Mariana-framework
Personal framework to build web applications.
Named after my awesome girlfriend.

# Why other framework?
For learning purposes of my two favorite systems to develop web applications (Laravel and angularJS),
I've decided to get my hands drity and try to make my own framework that implements all the awesome characteristics that made me fall in love with them
BUT without studying their internals (unlike as with the person who this is named after). By doing so, I have to go deep as I can in my knowledge of both
programing languages and to start thinking outside the box.

Laravel: Router, MVC System, ORM, Blade.
Angular: Awesome Templating system.

# To Do's:
* Finnish and secure the ORM.
* Implement some security settings like CSRF
* Implement DEV mode ON/OFF.
* Build Framework Page and repository of snippets ( PHP: login system, location system, etc, JS: modules for the framework )
