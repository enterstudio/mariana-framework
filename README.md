# Mariana-framework
Personal framework to build web applications.
Named after my awesome girlfriend.

# Purpose of the project
In programming there is a Golden Rule that is: "DO NOT REINVENT TEH WHEEL".
This project is not about reinventing the wheel, is about learning as much as I can about how the wheel works, because sometimes, the wheel crashes and a tipical programmer gets stuck.
Mariana's Framework might not be the best framework but it's intended to be the one with fastest learning curve and for sure, the most satisfying to build.

# Why other framework?
For learning purposes of my two favorite systems to develop web applications (Laravel and angularJS),
I've decided to get my hands drity and try to make my own framework that implements all the awesome characteristics that made me fall in love with them
BUT without studying their internals. By doing so, I have to go deep as I can in my knowledge of both
programing languages and to start thinking outside the box.

Laravel: Router, MVC System, ORM, Blade, Modular Coding and Autoloading.
Angular: Awesome Templating system - Two Way data-binding.

# To Do's:
* Test Session Folder.
* Finnish and secure the ORM.
* Finnish Logging Class
* Finnish Debug Class
* Finnish php view class
* Finnish php template organizer
* Nested scope items inside other scope items example scope paragraph cannot have a scope link inside <p>jndsjn<a href="{{}}">link</a></p>
* Implement CSRF

* Build Framework Page and repository of snippets ( PHP: login system, location system, etc, JS: modules for the framework )
